Subject: Query on Trading Windows for Acme Corp Deal

Hi Partner,

I'm cross-referencing the executive offer letters with our internal policies before the Acme Corp deal closes.

Specifically, I'm looking at the document named 'contract_05_tradingwindow.pdf'. The policy seems very strict. I also checked the main 'contract_03_insiderpolicy.pdf', and I want to confirm that all executives in the deal are fully briefed on these restrictions.

A violation here could be a major compliance issue. Let me know if you'd like me to draft a summary for the deal team.

Best,
Junior Associate
